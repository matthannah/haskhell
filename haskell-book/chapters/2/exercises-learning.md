# Learning Exercises
Exercises that come out throughout the chapter

## Comprehension Check
1. How would we change the following lines of code so that they are usable in the GHCi (REPL)? `half x = x / 2` and `square x = x * x`

    ```
    # Use the let keyword
    let half x = x / 2
    let square x = x * x
    ```

2. Write a function that can accept one argument and work for all the following expressions

    ```
    3.14 * (5 * 5)
    3.14 * (10 * 10)
    3.14 * (2 * 2)
    3.14 * (4 * 4)

    squareAndMultiplyByPi x = 3.14 * (x * x)
    ```

3. There is a value in Prelude called pi; use this in the function written above

    ```
    squareAndMultiplyByPi x = pi * (x * x)
    ```

## Parentheses and Association
Decide whether the added parentheses from a) to b) change the results of the function
1. a) `8 + 7 * 9` b) `(8 + 7) * 9`

    ```
    The parentheses change the result:
    a) 7 * 9 is evaluated first
    b) 8 + 7 is evaluated first
    ```

2. a) `perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)` b) `perimeter x y = x * 2 + y * 2`

    ```
    The parentheses do not change the result since * is evaluated first
    ```

3. a) `f x = x / 2 + 9` b) `f x = x / (2 + 9)`

    ```
    The parentheses change the result:
    a) x / 2 is evaluated first
    b) 2 + 9 is evaluated first
    ```

## Heal the Sick
The following code samples are broken and wonâ€™t compile. Find the mistakes and fix them so that they will.
1. REPL Code:

    ```
    let area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)

    # Solution:
    let area x = 3.14 * (x * x) # white space between '3.' and '14'
    ```

2. REPL Code:

    ```
    let double x = b * 2

    # Solution:
    let double x = x * 2 # variable b not in scope
    ```

3. Source Code File:

    ```
    x = 7
     y = 10
    f = x + y

    # Solution:
    x = 7
    y = 10 # white space before definition of y
    f = x + y
    ```

## A Head Code
Determine in your head what the following expressions will return, then validate in the REPL:
1. `let x = 5 in x` -> `5`
2. `let x = 5 in x * x` -> `25`
3. `let x = 5; y = 6 in x * y` -> `30`
4. `let x = 3; y = 1000 in x + 3` -> `6`

REPL:
```
Prelude> let x = 5 in x
5
Prelude> let x = 5 in x * x
25
Prelude> let x = 5; y = 6 in x * y
30
Prelude> let x = 3; y = 1000 in x + 3
6
```

# Rewrite with where clause
Rewrite the following in a file named `where.hs`:
1. let x = 3; y = 1000 in x * 3 + y
2. let y = 10; x = 10 * 5 + y in x * 5
3. let x = 7; y = negate x; z = y * 10 in z / x + y
