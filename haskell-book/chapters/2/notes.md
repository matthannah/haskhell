# Notes
**Stack**
- Program for developing Haskell projects
- See http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

**GHCi**
- Interactive environment (REPL) for running Haskell code
- Once stack is installed, run the command `stack ghci` in a shell to open up the REPL
- If the REPL is open, you should see `Prelude>`

**Prelude**
- A library of standard functions, which stack ghci automatically loads
- You can turn prelude off, or use alternative preludes

**GHCi commands**
- Special commands start with the colon character `:`
- These commands are not Haskell code, rather a way to interact with the REPL
- :quit is an example of a special command available in GHCi
